# Capstone Project - Final Assessment

*Applied Data Science Capstone - [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/applied-data-science-capstone/home/welcome)*



## Business problem

In this project we will try to find the the right location for a coffee shop in London (understanding location as Borough or cluster of Boroughs). The criteria to classify and rank the different Boroughs is agreed with the client.

Demographic preferences.

1. Growing population
2. Working population
3. Mid-high income
4. Low crime rate



## Analytics approach

We are going to search for different sources of data that combined can help us make a better decision. The data we are going to analyze can be grouped into:

1. Pure demographics data. Looking at areas where the population is growing.
2. Profiling data including unemployment rates, average gross income and average house price and crime indicators.
3. Business metrics, number of businesses, two-year business survival rate.
4. Competition and other business in the area information.
