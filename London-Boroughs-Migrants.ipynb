    "# London Boroughs Population (Analysis on migration and post-Brexit potential impact)\n",
    "It is well-known that the UK is going to leave the EU shortly. London is a multicultural city with a wide variety nationalities. Some of those nationalities have gathered in certain areas. Brexit is not going to affect the people that are already living in the UK. However, I would like to analyse the composition of the different boroughs in London looking at the migrant population and businesses and hypothesise with a potential hard brexit that forces all migrants to leave the country.\n",
